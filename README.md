# AngleSharp.Demos.DotnetConf

Sample codes as shown at the Dotnet Conf in September 2019.

## Using the Sample Codes

The demo application consists of several projects all contained in one solution. Each project is an executable that just runs in the console - .NET Core 2.2 console applications.

Every project is self-contained with the exception of demo 04. Here, you'll also need to run a local server. The repository already contains a simple version; in the "node-login" folder you'll find a Node.js application. Just install the dependencies using

```sh
npm i
```

then start the server with

```sh
npm start
```

from the folder.

If you have anything to add to the samples, then feel free to do so. Push requests are always highly appreciated.
